## Features :

* User-friendly interface: The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their symptoms and receive disease predictions.

* Disease prediction: The app employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the symptoms and medical history provided by the user, and predicts the likelihood of having various diseases.

* Personalized results: The predictions are tailored to the individual user based on their unique symptoms and medical history.

## About : 

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Streamlit. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. The webapp can predict following Diseases:

* Diabetes
* Heart Disease
* Parkinson's Disease

## Models and Prediction Accuracy :
|Disease| Algorithm |	Accuracy|
|---|-----------|--------|
|1.	Diabetes|	SVM |	0.77|
|2.	Heart Disease	|Logistic Regression|	0.85|
|3.	Parkinsonâ€™s Disease| SVM | 0.88
